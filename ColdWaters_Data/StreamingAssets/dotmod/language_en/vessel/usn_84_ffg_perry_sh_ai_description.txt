ShipClass=Perry SH
Description=Oliver Hazard Perry-class Frigate Short Hull
Aircraft=1 SH-2F Seasprite
History=The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate ships were produced in 445-foot (136 m) long "short-hull" (Flight I) and 453-foot (138 m) long "long-hull" (Flight III) variants. Both were designed primarily as anti-aircraft and anti-submarine warfare guided-missile warships intended to provide open-ocean escort of amphibious warfare ships and merchant ship convoys in moderate threat environments in a potential war with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries, with short-hulled warships carrying the smaller and less-capable SH-2 Seasprite LAMPS I. They could also provide air defense against and anti-ship missiles. These warships are equipped to escort and protect aircraft carrier battle groups, amphibious landing groups, underway replenishment groups, and merchant ship convoys.
