ShipClass=Valiant
Description=Valiant-class Nuclear Attack Submarine
History=HMS Valiant and HMS Warspite were the first two all-British Nuclear Attack Submarines for the Royal Navy. Similar in design to the earlier HMS Dreadnought they employed innovations such as rafting and a new Rolls-Royce nuclear reactor to be significantly quieter. Both Valiant and Warspite served the Royal Navy for nearly 30 years and are now awaiting recycling.
