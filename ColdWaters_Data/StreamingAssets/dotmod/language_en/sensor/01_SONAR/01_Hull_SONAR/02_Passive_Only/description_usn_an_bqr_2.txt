usn_an_bqr_2=AN/BQR-2=Derived from the German wartime GHG sonar suite as fitted on the Type XXI electroboot, the BQR-2 is a medium frequency sonar fitted to most USN subs until the Thresher/Permit class. Though adequate for its day, by the 1980's this system is woefully obsolete and nearly blind against all but the oldest Soviet boats.
