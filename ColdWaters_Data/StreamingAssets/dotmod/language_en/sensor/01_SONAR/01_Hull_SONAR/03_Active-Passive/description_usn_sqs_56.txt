usn_sqs_56=SQS-56=The SQS-56 is a modern hull-mounted sonar found on Perry-class frigates which features digital implementation, system control by a built-in mini computer, and an advanced display system. Computer controlled functions provide a system that is extremely flexible and easy to operate. The computer is also used to provide automated fault detection and localization with a built-in training capability. The sonar is an active/passive, preformed beam, digital sonar providing panoramic echo ranging and panoramic (DIMUS) passive surveillance. A single operator can search, track, classify and designate multiple targets from the active system while simultaneously maintaining anti-torpedo surveillance on the passive display.
