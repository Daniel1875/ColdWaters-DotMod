wp_mgk-400=MGK-400 "Rubikon"=NATO reporting name: "Shark Gill". Part of a new generation of Soviet sonar systems, this cylindrical low frequency array is used on submarines where it equips the Victor III, Charlie II, Delta III and IV, Typhoon and Oscar classes. Compared to the earlier Shark Teeth, this set is better than the BQQ-2 of the early Permit- and Sturgeon classes, and almost comparable to the BBQ-5 that equips the latest US subs.\n \nIt is rumoured that an advanced version of this suite equips the Sierra-class submarine, but little is known at this time.="Rubikon"
