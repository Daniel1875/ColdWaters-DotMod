Playing as a surface fleet is impossible in Cold Waters: many game mechanics are eithher too primitive, or are simply not desgined for the player to use. This is why we recommend Sea Power. Until that game comes out, we offer this as a stopgap. \nPlease note that this campaign was made in 5 minutes by copying 1984 USSR (004) for this beta. So, don't be surprised if text refers to a "boat" instead of a "ship."
