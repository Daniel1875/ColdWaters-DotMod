Sentence1=The US Navy carrier strike group deployed in <ENDLOCATION_PR> was completely destroyed as a result of a Soviet submarine attack. A representative of the General Staff of the USSR Navy confirmed that this is the result of the work of Soviet submariners and said that unfortunately he could not reveal the names of the heroes, since the location and areas of operation of each boat is a military secret.

Sentence2=Is the use of aircraft carriers too risky?<n>In the light of recent events, the question arises whether effective actions of aircraft carriers in the northern seas are possible? Many congressmen are calling for aircraft carriers to be withdrawn from the combat zone, believing that the risk is too great./ The Soviet newspaper Pravda describes the events as follows:<n>On guard of the Motherland!<n>Submariners of the Northern Fleet have once again proved that they will not let the enemy walk freely in the northern seas. "What can one boat do against a mighty carrier group?" - so the American admiral reasoned. And he cruelly miscalculated! Our submariners, following the precept of Suvorov, "to fight not by numbers, but by skill," bravely entered the battle and completely defeated the enemy! No more planes will take off from this aircraft carrier, and the pitiful remnants of the "mighty" squadron, with their tails between their legs, ran to their ports to lick their wounds.
