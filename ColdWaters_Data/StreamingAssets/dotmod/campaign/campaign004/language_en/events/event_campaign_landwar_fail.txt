Title=<b>THE WAR IS OVER!</b>
Sentence1=The Soviet blitzkrieg in Europe was defeated. Having repulsed the initial onslaught, NATO troops went on the offensive and pushed the ATS troops to the borders of the USSR. In view of the senselessness of continuing military operations, the Union was forced to move to peace negotiations.
Sentence2=The defeat in the war led to the collapse of the ATS unit. Some republics of the USSR have also expressed their intention to secede, but their fate is still unclear, since Soviet troops are on their territory and negotiations are not over yet.
