Title=<b>THE COLLAPSE of NATO</b>
Sentence1=Despite the resistance of NATO member countries, the Warsaw Pact troops managed to capture all strategically important regions in Europe. The withdrawal of the Warsaw Pact troops to the border of France and to the Pas-de-Calais clearly hints at the destructive prospects of further escalation on the part of the French and British governments. The Soviet Navy completely controls the North Atlantic and is able to completely block Great Britain.
Sentence2=NATO's inability to fulfill its promises to protect its member countries has led to an avalanche-like collapse of the bloc. Many countries have begun negotiations with the USSR on a separate peace.
