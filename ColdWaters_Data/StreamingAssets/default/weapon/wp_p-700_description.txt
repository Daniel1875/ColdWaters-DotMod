WeaponDescription=Special: Universal\nThe SS-N-19 Shipwreck, or Russian П-700 «Granit», is a Russian naval anti-ship and land-attack cruise missile. It comes in surface-to-surface and submarine-launched variants. It was designed in the 1970s to replace the SS-N-7 Starbright and the SS-N-9 Siren, both effective missiles but with too short range to reliably attack U.S. Navy carrier battlegroups, given the development of new SAM systems. For gameplay purposes, the land-attack and anti-ship variants have been combined into one missile.
