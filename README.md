# ColdWaters-DotMod

Welcome to DotMod!

DotMod is an attempt to create a more organized mod that is closer to vanilla vessel and weapons characteristics for Cold Waters than other, currently-existing mods. This also generally results in more realistic sensor and performance comparisons.

DotMod also adds RPG elements to the Cold Waters campaigns, adds new campaigns, introduces a new fleet of vessels (mostly) custom built for the game by our team of modellers, and adds new gameplay elements like Diesel-electric Subs, Anti-Aircraft Missiles, etc.
