Presenting: DotMod for Cold Waters.

This is an attempt to create a more organized mod that is closer to vanilla vessel and weapons characteristics than other, currently-existing mods. This also generally results in more realistic sensor comparisons.
While DM incorporates some stuff from EM made by our developers (and other items which we have the right to use), it is built from the ground up on the base game to avoid many of the flaws found in that mod, some of which would take more time to fix than re-do from scratch.
(EM) - that marks features also working in EM

This is an early Beta release, and will be tweaked and improved based on feedback and additional sources where possible. We encourage you to join our Discord at: https://discord.gg/DrmztcDYYf to help us further tweak the mod to give the best possible experience. We also hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoy working on it!

We are still in the process of creating documentation. Expect that with the final release of the mod.

[INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS]
WINDOWS (NOT WINDOWS 7 OR PRIOR):
Download the release .zip from the GitHub page. Extract the contents of the .zip file into a folder somewhere where you can find it.
Then, navigate to the Cold Waters directory in which you wish to install the mod in File Explorer. Right click on the address bar and select "Copy as text."
Return to where you extracted the mod, and launch DotModInstaller.exe. Follow the instructions present in the installer.
Then, the mod should be installed to Jone Soft Generic Mod Enabler (JSGME), which may be called "EpicModInstall" if you used that mod prior to DotMod. Launch that and enable DotMod, as well as any addons you have installed alongside DotMod.
Launch ColdWaters, and if the loading screen appears, you have done everything correctly. Enjoy!

-----------
Our team also wants thank several people for their help and inspiration:
Nils a.k.a. Julhelm - Without you there would not be CW and without your help our mod would be missing small, yet critical, info! We'd also like to thank you for that Marmoset material that kept our ships hidden by fog. 
Gsmith93-We thank you for your incredible 1990 campaign! It gave us such a good base to work off of and saved us so much time.
Oleg Vygovsky - You've showed that impossible is actually possible and provided info and support
Nikita Nichagin - If you hadn't called Dot to CW, we woldnt be here now! Additionally, thanks for the info and support through the years.
Kostya Martynov - Your analysis and info you've posted in your group was very valuable for creation of this mod.
Evgeny Mas - Your voiceover adds an incredible amount of immersion to playing Russian vessels.
Steel Shark - We're still using the HUD you made for EM, even if it's tweaked a little. Nice work.
Epic - Credits for ideas on chaff and WH behaviour and assistance in WH parameters setup, shkwal sprie and several medals sprites and edited parameters of the wake trals. It was fun to improve EM, but sadly your attitude eventually drive all content makers from the project.

Special thanks is also given to model makers who have uploaded thier models for anyone to use, especially on 3D Warehouse!
